* Description: Starcraft II is a military science fiction real-time strategy video game developed by Blizzard Entertainment. Using AngularJS, I created a page for looking up information on individual combat units within the game. The unit information is held in a JSON object, and is retrieved by the AngularJS $http service. The page makes use of a number of AngularJS features, including routing, filtering, and directives (ng-model, ng-repeat, ng-show). 
* Key technologies: AngularJS, HTML5, CSS3
